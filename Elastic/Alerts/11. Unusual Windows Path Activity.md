# Unusual Windows Path Activity

Identifies processes started from atypical folders in the file system, which might indicate malware execution or persistence mechanisms. In corporate Windows environments, software installation is centrally managed and it is unusual for programs to be executed from user or temporary directories. Processes executed from these locations can denote that a user downloaded software directly from the Internet or a malicious script or macro executed malware.

## Triage and analysis

**Investigating Unusual Windows Path Activity**

In corporate Windows environments, software is typically managed centrally, making execution from user or temporary directories uncommon. Adversaries exploit this by running malware from these atypical paths, bypassing standard security measures. The Unusual Windows Path Activity detection rule leverages machine learning to identify such anomalies, flagging potential persistence or execution tactics used by attackers.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process name and path to determine if it is a known legitimate application or a suspicious executable.
- Check the parent process to understand how the process was initiated and if it correlates with expected user behavior or known software installations.
- Investigate the user account associated with the process execution to verify if the activity aligns with their typical usage patterns or if it appears anomalous.
- Examine the file hash of the executable to see if it matches known malware signatures or if it has been flagged by any threat intelligence sources.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of potential malware and unauthorized access.
- Terminate any suspicious processes identified as running from atypical directories to halt malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system using updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to identify and remove any malicious files.
- Review and restore any modified system processes or configurations to their original state to ensure system integrity.
