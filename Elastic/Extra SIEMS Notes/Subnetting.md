#### What is Subnetting?

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). This helps in efficient use of IP addresses and improves network management and security.

#### Why Subnetting is Important:

1. **Efficient IP Address Utilization:**
    
    - Prevents wastage of IP addresses by creating smaller subnets that can be assigned to different departments or branches.
        
2. **Improves Network Performance:**
    
    - Reduces network congestion by limiting the size of each subnet.
        
3. **Enhances Security:**
    
    - Isolates different parts of the network, making it harder for attackers to move laterally within the network.
        

#### Subnet Mask:

A subnet mask is used to define the network and host portions of an IP address.

- **Network Portion:** Identifies the specific network.
    
- **Host Portion:** Identifies individual devices within the network.
    

#### Example:

- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.1
    
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0
    

In this example:

- The first three octets (192.168.1) represent the network portion.
    
- The last octet (1) represents the host portion.
