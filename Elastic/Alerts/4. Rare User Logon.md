# Rare User Logon

A machine learning job found an unusual user name in the authentication logs. An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. An inactive user account (because the user has left the organization) that becomes active may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application.

**Investigating Rare User Logon**

This rule uses a machine learning job to detect an unusual user name in authentication logs, which could detect new accounts created for persistence.

**Possible investigation steps**

- Check if the user was newly created and if the company policies were followed.
- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.
- Investigate other alerts associated with the involved users during the past 48 hours.
- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.

**Response and remediation**

- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).


# SMTP on Port 26/TCP

This rule detects events that may indicate use of SMTP on TCP port 26. This port is commonly used by several popular mail transfer agents to deconflict with the default SMTP port 25. This port has also been used by a malware family called BadPatch for command and control of Windows systems.

**Triage and analysis**

**Investigating SMTP on Port 26/TCP**

SMTP, typically operating on port 25, is crucial for email transmission. However, port 26 is often used to avoid conflicts or restrictions on port 25. Adversaries exploit this by using port 26 for covert command and control, as seen with the BadPatch malware. The detection rule identifies suspicious SMTP activity on port 26 by analyzing network traffic patterns, helping to uncover potential threats.

**Possible investigation steps**

- Review the network traffic logs to identify any unusual patterns or anomalies associated with TCP port 26, focusing on the event.dataset fields such as network_traffic.flow or zeek.smtp.
- Analyze the source and destination IP addresses involved in the alert to determine if they are known or associated with any previous suspicious activities.
- Check for any additional alerts or logs related to the same source or destination IP addresses to identify potential patterns or repeated attempts of communication on port 26.
- Investigate the context of the communication by examining the payload data, if available, to identify any indicators of compromise or malicious content.

**Response and remediation**

- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further command and control communication via port 26.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the isolated system using updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to identify and remove the BadPatch malware or any other malicious software.
- Review and analyze network logs to identify any other systems that may have communicated with the same command and control server, and isolate those systems as well.
- Change all passwords and credentials that may have been compromised or accessed by the affected system to prevent unauthorized access.
