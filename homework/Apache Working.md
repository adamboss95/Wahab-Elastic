## Apache server

### Example Scenario:

1. You type `http://example.com` in your browser.
    
2. Your browser sends an HTTP request to the Apache server at `example.com`.
    
3. Apache receives the request, processes it, and determines that you are requesting the `index.html` file.
    
4. Apache retrieves `index.html` from its filesystem.
    
5. Apache sends an HTTP response back to your browser with the content of `index.html`.
    
6. Your browser displays the webpage based on the content of `index.html`.
