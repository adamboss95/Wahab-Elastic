# General
### True Positive (TP):

- **Definition**: The test correctly identifies a positive case.
    
- **Example**: A medical test accurately detects a disease in a patient who has the disease.
    

### True Negative (TN):

- **Definition**: The test correctly identifies a negative case.
    
- **Example**: A medical test accurately identifies a healthy individual who does not have the disease.
    

### False Positive (FP):

- **Definition**: The test incorrectly identifies a positive case.
    
- **Example**: A medical test indicates a person has a disease when they are actually healthy (a false alarm).
    

### False Negative (FN):

- **Definition**: The test incorrectly identifies a negative case.
    
- **Example**: A medical test fails to detect a disease in a patient who actually has the disease (a missed detection).


### Benign

**Benign** is files, activities, or events that are harmless and not associated with malicious intent or actions.

### Benign File:

- **Definition**: A file that is safe and does not contain any malicious code or behavior.
    
- **Example**: A legitimate software update file from a trusted source.
    

### Benign Event:

- **Definition**: An event or activity that is not harmful and does not pose a security threat.
    
- **Example**: A regular user login event from a known IP address during normal business hours.

| Scenario       | Outcome                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| True Positive  | Rule Matched, Attack Present       |
| True Negative  | No Rule Matched, No Attack Present |
| False Positive | No Rule Matched, Attack Present    |
| False Negative | No Rule Matched, Attack Present    |

|Scenario|Rule Matches Attack?|Attack Present?|Example|Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**True Positive**|Yes|Yes|Detecting actual malware|Valid alert, appropriate response|
|**True Negative**|No|No|Normal network traffic|Valid absence of alert|
|**False Positive**|Yes|No|Legitimate activity flagged as suspicious|False alarm, unnecessary response|
|**False Negative**|No|Yes|Undetected malware due to rule limitations|Undetected attack, potential harm|


### True Positive

- **Definition**: A security alert or detection that correctly identifies a real threat.
    
- **Example**: Your system detects and blocks a real malware attack.
    

### True Negative

- **Definition**: A situation where no security alert is raised, and there are no threats.
    
- **Example**: Your system scans a file and correctly determines it is safe, raising no alert.
    

### False Positive

- **Definition**: A security alert or detection that incorrectly identifies benign activity as a threat.
    
- **Example**: Your system flags a legitimate software update as malware.
    

### False Negative

- **Definition**: A situation where a real threat is present, but no security alert is raised.
    
- **Example**: Your system fails to detect an actual malware attack.
