# ELK

**Elastic Agent**: Collects logs, metrics, and other types of data from various sources and forwards them to Elasticsearch or Logstash. It's a unified agent designed to simplify data collection.

**Logstash**: Collects, processes, and transforms logs and other data before sending it to Elasticsearch. It acts as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, allowing you to filter, enrich, and structure the data.

**Kibana**: Provides visualization and analysis tools for the data stored in Elasticsearch. It converts the stored data into interactive charts, graphs, dashboards, and other visualizations.

### Example

Imagine you have a website and want to provide a powerful search feature for your users. You can use Elasticsearch to index all the content on your site, allowing users to quickly find relevant information through a search bar. Additionally, you can use Logstash to collect and process logs from your web servers and store them in Elasticsearch. Then, you can visualize and analyze these logs in Kibana to monitor site performance and detect issues.
