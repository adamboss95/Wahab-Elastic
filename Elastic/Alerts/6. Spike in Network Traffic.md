# Spike in Network Traffic

A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity. Large-scale data exfiltration may produce a burst of network traffic; this could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

**Investigating Spike in Network Traffic**

Machine learning models analyze network traffic patterns to identify anomalies, such as unexpected spikes. These spikes may indicate malicious activities like data exfiltration or denial-of-service attacks. Adversaries exploit network vulnerabilities to flood traffic or extract data. The _Spike in Network Traffic_ rule leverages ML to flag unusual traffic surges, aiding in early threat detection and response.

**Possible investigation steps**

- Review the timestamp and duration of the traffic spike to determine if it correlates with any scheduled business activities or known events.
- Analyze the source and destination IP addresses involved in the traffic spike to identify any unfamiliar or suspicious entities.
- Examine the types of network protocols and services involved in the spike to assess if they align with typical network usage patterns.
- Check for any recent changes in network configurations or security policies that might explain the unusual traffic patterns.

**Response and remediation**

- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or traffic flooding.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of network logs to identify the source and destination of the traffic spike, focusing on any unauthorized or suspicious IP addresses.
- Block identified malicious IP addresses and domains at the firewall and update intrusion prevention systems to prevent further access.
- If data exfiltration is suspected, perform a data integrity check to assess any potential data loss or compromise.
