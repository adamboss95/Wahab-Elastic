Imagine you have a website and want to provide a powerful search feature for your users. You can use Elasticsearch to index all the content on your site, allowing users to quickly find relevant information through a search bar. Additionally, you can use Logstash to collect and process logs from your web servers and store them in Elasticsearch. Then, you can visualize and analyze these logs in Kibana to monitor site performance and detect issues.
